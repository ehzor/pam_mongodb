INTRODUCTION
=====================================
pam-mongodb is a PAM module for Linux systems to authenticate a user via mongoDB database, released by Zorveo Research.

The general idea of this is that to authenticate users on the network, they will have to have a valid account
to a database on the mongoDB server.

When used, the user will be prompted for their username and password that they will use to authenticate to the database.
If the username is left blank, it will use the name of the user given at login.  For example, if person A were to log into
a system with the username of "hellosally", and the user didn't supply a username to the prompt for the module, then the 
module will use "hellosally" for the database username.  However, empty passwords are not supported, as this also meant to be
a secure module as well (as much as it can be at least).

INFORMATION
=====================================
This was done more so as a proof of concept to myself more than anything.  I haven't seen a PAM
module for this yet, and figured one should be released.  The only thing that I ask is that you submit any 
reports to me (via Google Code), or by e-mailing me at eric@zorveo.com.  Also, feel free to e-mail me any 
criticisms (good or bad), or anything else you feel like.

I'm releasing this to the world as-is.  I tested this on my system, but I can't guarantee it will work on others.

Source code is released for study, improvements, etc...  I believe in the open-source nature of the world.  I'm sure in due time
my code will be named as someone else's.  It's the nature of open-source.  I figure it this way, though...if my code helped someone,
even to do an "unethical" action, then it must've been that good.

HOW TO USE
=====================================
If you already meet the requirements of pre-installed software (they MUST be installed prior to using), you can copy the 
module to /lib/security, make sure you chmod +x it first though to be safe.  After that, skip the next paragraph.  If you 
need to compile the code, though, continue reading.

To compile, simply run the "build" script.  This will do all the work for you.  Once compiled and installed (default path 
is /lib/security/, which is where most PAM modules are stored), you well edit any of the systems that use PAM.  Usually these 
files are found in /etc/pam.d, but I can't gurantee it's that way on every system.

Now, until you know this works, I'd suggest the following line be placed at the top of the service file (i.e.: /etc/pam.d/sshd):
auth optional pam_mongodb.so server=<servername> db=<db name>

However, replace <servername> with the actual server IP or host (i.e.: server=10.0.0.5), and same with the db the user should authenticate to.
Also, add port=... if the mongoDB listens on a non-standard (27107) port.

This makes the module active, but isn't mandatory to be successful authentication.  When you can verify it works, then
replace "optional" with "required" or "requisite".  If you want this to be the only authentication method, then comment out
(put a "#" withou the quotes in front of) each line that begins with "auth".

SUPPORTED MODULE ARGUMENTS
=====================================
It is highly suggested to pass arguments (shown above in "HOW TO USE") so it will actually work.  By default, it connects to 
127.0.0.1:27107, using databae "db".  Here's a full list of supported arguments, with descriptions:

NAME	-	USAGE			-	Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
server	-	server=127.0.0.1	-	The IP (or hostname) to connect to.  If spaces are supplied, make sure the value is in quotes.
port	-	port=27107		-	What port the server is listening on.
db	-	db=userauth		-	The database for the user to authenticate to (they must have an account for the database).
askall	-	askall			-	Prompts the user for username, password, and all of the above options.

To use all of these, you can make the module line look like this (order is not important):
auth required pam_mongodb.so server=1.1.1.1 port=6667 db=testing askall

Note though that "askall" responses will overwrite any others.

FILES
=======================================
pam-mongodb consists of the following files:

README		- This file
pam_mongodb.c	- The source file for the module (the only file to boot)
build		- Script to compile and move module to the necessary location
pam_mongodb.so  - The compiled module that must be placed in /lib/security

KNOWN ISSUES
=======================================
- You must be root to install this...not something I'm going to fix either, its a permissions (read: security) issue.

REPORTING ISSUES
=======================================
If you run into any bugs or anything, please post them on the GitHub page (https://github.com/ehzor/pam_mongodb).  I personally 
prefer keeping a centralized database of information for projects, and this will help other users as well.  E-mails asking for 
support will be sent a link to the bug tracker on GitHub.
